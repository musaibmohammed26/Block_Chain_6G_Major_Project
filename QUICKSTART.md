## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Database connection refused"
**Solution:**
- Ensure MySQL is running
- Check database credentials in settings.py or .env file
- Verify DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD are correct

### Issue: "Page not found (404)"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're using the correct URL
- Check that Django development server is running
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue: "No module named 'core'"
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in the correct project directory
- Activate the virtual environment
- Run `python manage.py` from the same directory as manage.py

### Issue: "CSRF verification failed"
**Solution:**
- Ensure cookies are enabled in your browser
- Clear browser cookies and cache
- Restart Django development server

### Issue: "You don't have permission to access this page"
**Solution:**
- You're likely logged in as non-admin user trying to access admin page
- Either login as admin user, or request admin privileges
- Admin can grant privileges in /admin/ → Users

### Issue: "Email already registered"
**Solution:**
- The email is already in use by another account
- Use a different email address or reset the password for the existing account
